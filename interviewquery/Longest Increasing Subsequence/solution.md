Explanation
This code examines the elements of the list one by one. For each element as we reach it, we then calculate the length of the longest subsequence that ends with that number. When we finish processing the list, we choose the highest of the calculated lengths as our answer.

For example, consider the list [2, 4, 9, 5, 6]. The lengths of the longest increasing subsequences that end at each number are [1, 2, 3, 3, 4], such that for the integer 5 in the original list, it is the 3rd in its subsequence.

Now, let’s say we add another element to the end of our list, making it [2, 4, 9, 5, 6, 7].

To calculate the length of the longest subsequence ending with 7, we examine all the previous numbers:

When we find a smaller number than 7, such as 6, we know we can add 7 after it, forming a subsequence that ends with 7.
The length of that new subsequence will be 5, which is the length of the longest subsequence ending with 6 plus 1 because we added the 7 afterward.
Another way to calculate the length of the longest subsequence ending with 7:

If there are smaller numbers than 7 in the previous position, the longest subsequence will be one more than the length of the longest subsequence ending with any of those.
If there are no smaller numbers, then the longest subsequence ending with 7 will be a length of 1.
Can you use this insight to code a solution?

Now let’s go through the code step by step:

First, we check if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, as there is no subsequence in an empty list.

if not nums:
    return 0
Then we create a list dp of the same length as the input list nums. Each element of dp will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends at the corresponding element in nums. We initialize each element of dp to 1 because a single element is always a valid increasing subsequence of length 1.

dp = [1] * len(nums)
We then use two nested loops to fill in the dp list. The outer loop iterates through the elements of the input list nums, starting from the second element. The inner loop iterates through all the elements before the current element i .

for i in range(1, len(nums)):
   for j in range(i):
Within the inner loop, we go through all of the elements before the one we are processing.

Whenever we find an element that is smaller, we know that we could form a subsequence by placing our number afterward.

The length of the longest subsequence ending with num[j] is dp[j], so now we’ll be able to form a sequence that’s dp[j] + 1 long.

We update the value of dp[i]if this number is higher than other values we found previously.

if nums[i] > nums[j]:
    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
Finally, after the loops have completed, we return the maximum value in the dp list, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the input list nums.

return max(dp)
